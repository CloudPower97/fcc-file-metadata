# API Micro Service: File Metadata Microservice

## Description

This project is part of the **FCC Apis And Microservices Certification**.

## User stories

1. I can `POST` <https://fcc-file-metadata-project.herokuapp.com/upload> with a _body_ of `form-data` to upload a file.

2. The `form-data` has the _key_ set to `upfile` and the _value_ of the file. We rely on this in testing.

3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name, and size in bytes within the `JSON` response.
